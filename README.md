## 🎯 Scope
To support early-stage builders on Polkadot with grants up to $10,000 per project. This fast-grants programme has a simple goal: anyone who wants to build on Polkadot can get initial funding to do so. The programme expects to fund up projects across a variety of themes, with a focus on projects building on Plaza/Polkadot Hub, games, and DeFi applications. Payments will be milestone-based and only made after successful delivery.

1. New developer acquisition via initiatives like hackathons, EasyA x Polkadot University, etc.
2. Fast funding via the Fast-Grants Programme
3. Additional grant funding through other treasury funnels (Open Source Developer Grants, DeFi Bounty, DOT Play)
4. VC funding through ecosystem VCs
